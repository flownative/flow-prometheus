# Prometheus client library for Neos Flow / PHP

This [Flow](https://flow.neos.io) package allows you to collect and
provide metrics to [Prometheus](https://www.prometheus.io). It supports
client-side aggregation of metrics data and provides an endpoint for
Prometheus for scraping these metrics.

## How does it work?

Your Flow application can provide different kinds of metrics, for
example the current number of registered users (a gauge), or the number
of requests to your API (a counter). Metrics values are stored in a
storage – currently only Redis is supported, and there's an in-memory
storage for testing.

The metrics endpoint (by default http(s)://your-host/metrics) collects
all current metric values from the storage and renders it in a format
which can be read by Prometheus. Therefore, metrics are _not_ collected
or generated during a request to the metrics endpoint. Depending on how
expensive it is to update a metric (think: number of incoming HTTP
requests vs. books sold but returned throughout the last 15 years), the
values may be updated on the fly (e.g. by registering a Flow HTTP
Component) or through a helper process (a cron-job or long-running
command-line process).

## Compatibility

The `flownative/prometheus` 0.* version branch supports Flow 5.x and
6.x, while `flownative/prometheus` 1.* supports Flow 7.0 and later.
Please note that this README applies to 1.*. [Refer to the "0" branches'
README](https://github.com/flownative/flow-prometheus/blob/0/README.md ,
if you are using an earlier version of this plugin).

## Installation

The Prometheus integration is installed as a regular Flow package via
Composer. For your existing project, simply include
`flownative/prometheus` into the dependencies of your Flow or Neos
distribution:

```bash
$ composer require flownative/prometheus
```

### Storage

By default, this plugin uses the `InMemoryStorage` for testing purposes.
You will want to use the `RedisStorage` instead, so you don't loose all
metrics values between requests. The `RedisStorage` contained in this
package does *not* require a special PHP extension, as it is implemented
in plain PHP.

In order to use the `RedisStorage`, create an `Objects.yaml` in your
package's or Flow distribution's `Configuration` directory and add the
following configuration:

```yaml
Flownative\Prometheus\DefaultCollectorRegistry:
  arguments:
    1:
      object: Flownative\Prometheus\Storage\RedisStorage

Flownative\Prometheus\Storage\RedisStorage:
  arguments:
    1:
      value:
        hostname: '%env:MY_REDIS_HOST%'
        port: '%env:MY_REDIS_PORT%'
        password: '%env:MY_REDIS_PASSWORD%'
        database: 20
```

In this example, environment variables are used for passing access
parameters to the `RedisStorage`. Test your setup by opening the path
`/metrics` of your Flow instance in a browser. You should see the
following comment:

```
# Flownative Prometheus Metrics Exporter: There are no collectors registered at the registry.
```

The `RedisStorage` also supports Redis cluster setups with Sentinel
servers. If you'd like to connect to a cluster and use Sentinels for
autodiscovery, omit the hostname and password options and use the
sentinel option instead:

```yaml
Flownative\Prometheus\Storage\RedisStorage:
  arguments:
    1:
      value:
        password: '%env:MY_REDIS_PASSWORD%'
        database: 20
        sentinels:
          - 'tcp://10.101.213.145:26379'
          - 'tcp://10.101.213.146:26379'
          - 'tcp://10.101.213.147:26379'
        service: 'mymaster'
```

Instead of providing sentinels as an array you can also set them as a
comma-separated string.

The `RedisStorage` can be configured to ignore connection errors. This
may protect your application against fatal errors at times when Redis is
not available. Of course, no metrics are stored while Redis connections
fail.

```yaml
Flownative\Prometheus\Storage\RedisStorage:
  arguments:
    1:
      value:
        hostname: '%env:MY_REDIS_HOST%'
        port: '%env:MY_REDIS_PORT%'
        password: '%env:MY_REDIS_PASSWORD%'
        database: 20
        ignoreConnectionErrors: true
```

### Telemetry Path

The path, where metrics are provided for scraping, is "/metrics" by
default. You can change this path by setting a respective option for the
HTTP middleware in `Objects.yaml`:

```yaml
Flownative\Prometheus\Http\MetricsExporterMiddleware:
  arguments:
    1:
      value:
        ## Path at which metrics are published for scraping
        telemetryPath: '/some-other-path'
```

### Security

By default, the telemetry endpoint is *not* active. It is active when
the environment variable `FLOWNATIVE_PROMETHEUS_ENABLE` is set to "true"
(ie. "true" is a string value!). You can achieve this by setting the
variable in your webserver's virtual host configuration.

The idea behind enabling telemetry through such a variable is, that you
configure your webserver to provide metrics through a different port
than your actual website or application. This way its easy to hide
metrics through firewall rules or by not providing access to that port
through your load balancer.

While setting up the telemetry endpoint on a dedicated port, it is also
possible to let it share the webserver's port.

The telemetry endpoint can also be protected by requiring clients to
authenticate first with username and password. HTTP Basic Authentication
is configured as follows (`Objects.yaml`):

```yaml
Flownative\Prometheus\Http\MetricsExporterMiddleware:
  arguments:
    1:
      value:
        basicAuth:

          # If set to non-empty values, HTTP Basic Auth is enabled:
          username: 'my-username'
          password: 'my-password'
    
          # Optional:
          realm: 'Acme App Metrics'
```

## Usage

The `DefaultCollectorRegistry` is pre-configured and can be injected via
Dependency Injection:

```php
    /**
     * @Flow\Inject
     * @var \Flownative\Prometheus\CollectorRegistry\DefaultCollectorRegistry
     */
    protected $collectorRegistry;
```

A simple counter:

```php
    $this->collectorRegistry->getCounter('acme_myproject_controller_hits_total')
        ->inc();   
```

A counter using labels:

```php
    $this->collectorRegistry->getCounter('acme_myproject_controller_hits_total')
        ->inc(1, ['result' => 'success']);   
    …
    $this->collectorRegistry->getCounter('acme_myproject_controller_hits_total')
        ->inc(1, ['result' => 'failed']);   
```

A gauge:

```php
    $this->collectorRegistry->getGauge('neos_flow_sessions')
        ->set(count($this->sessionManager->getActiveSessions()),
            [
                'state' => 'active'
            ]
        );
```

Setting for each metric:

```yaml
Flownative:
  Prometheus:
    metrics:
      acme_myproject_controller_hits_total:
        type: counter
        help: 'metric description'
      acme_myproject_successful_login_total:
        type: counter
        help: 'metric description'
```

Manual usage of the Collector Registry, using the `InMemoryStorage`:

````php
    $registry = new CollectorRegistry(new InMemoryStorage());
    $registry->register('flownative_prometheus_test_calls_total', Counter::TYPE, 'a test call counter', ['tests', 'counter']);

    $counter = $registry->getCounter('flownative_prometheus_test_calls_total');
    $counter->inc(5.5);

    $sampleCollections = $registry->collect();

    $renderer = new Renderer();
    echo ($renderer->render($sampleCollections));
````

## Running the tests

All key features are backed by unit tests. Currently, you need Redis
running in order to run them. Provide the necessary credentials via
`REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, and `REDIS_PASSWORD` (see `Objects.yaml`
contained in this package).

Apart from that, tests are run like any other unit test suite for Flow.
